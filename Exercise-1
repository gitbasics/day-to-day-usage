# Exercise 1 - First git commands

### This exercise is to practice using some first time git commands. These commands are some things you would use when initially creating a git repo, creating content, and adding that content to a git commit  

### Configuring git
1. First things first is configuring your local git install. Likely it only configured very minimal settings if any when you installed it.
  * git config --global user.name "_first_name last_name_"
    * This will set the name associated with any commits you create.
<<<<<<< HEAD
  * git config --global user.email "**your_email**"
=======
  * git config --global user.email "_your_email_"
>>>>>>> feature/adding-actionable-exercise
    * This will set the email associated with any commits you create.
  * git config --global core.editor "_editor_"
    * This will set the editor used when running commands such as _git commit_
2. Now that we've configured our git installs, let's create a local repository.
  * git init _repo_name_
    * This will create a repository with the name you specify. Try to use a name that is intuitive as to what the code does.
