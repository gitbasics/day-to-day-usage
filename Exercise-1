# Exercise 1 - First git commands

### This exercise is to practice using some first time git commands. These commands are some things you would use when initially creating a git repo, creating content, and adding that content to a git commit  

### Configuring git
1. First things first is configuring your local git install. Likely it only configured very minimal settings if any when you installed it.
  * git config --global user.name "_first_name last_name_"
    * This will set the name associated with any commits you create.
  * git config --global user.email "your_email"
    * This will set the email associated with any commits you create.
  * git config --global core.editor "_editor_"
    * This will set the editor used when running commands such as _git commit_
